# Rand.l-the-Discord-Bot
Python based Discord bot that does a number of commands when prompted in the text channel
The bot currently pulls api requests from Reddit (r/blursedimages) and Scryfall's Database

Current commands are:

- $sup - say hi!

- $meme - pull a random meme from a subreddit

- $cardsearch - search card names or text in Scryfall

- $cardinfo - get the weblisting for a card or cards in Scryfall


The main program Randl has all of the functions built in and just needs a custom bot token for the bot you create. However, if you are just wanting the code for the meme pull API or the Scryfall card search API, those are uploaded in separate programs as well!
